Kubernetes Deployment Strategies 👇

Each strategy offers a unique approach to manage updates.

𝟭. 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲:
All existing instances are terminated at once, and new instances with the updated version are created

𝘋𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦: Yes
𝘜𝘴𝘦 𝘤𝘢𝘴𝘦: Non-critical applications or during initial development stages

𝟮. 𝗥𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗨𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲:
Application instances are updated one by one, ensuring high availability during the process

𝘋𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦: No
𝘜𝘴𝘦 𝘤𝘢𝘴𝘦: Periodic releases

𝟯. 𝗦𝗵𝗮𝗱𝗼𝘄:
A copy of the live traffic is redirected to the new version for testing without affecting production users

This is the most complex deployment strategy and involves establishing mock services to interact with the new version of the deployment

𝘋𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦: No
𝘜𝘴𝘦 𝘤𝘢𝘴𝘦: Validating new version performance and behavior in a real environment

𝟰. 𝗖𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗿𝘆:
The new version is released to a subset of users or servers for testing before broader deployment

𝘋𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦: No
𝘜𝘴𝘦 𝘤𝘢𝘴𝘦: Impact validation on a subset of users

𝟱. 𝗕𝗹𝘂𝗲-𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻:
- Two identical environments are maintained: one with the current version (blue) and the other with the updated version (green)
- Traffic starts with blue, then switches to the prepared green environment for the updated version

𝘋𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦: No
𝘜𝘴𝘦 𝘤𝘢𝘴𝘦: High-stake updates

𝟲. 𝗔/𝗕 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴:
Multiple versions are concurrently tested on different users to compare performance or user experience

𝘋𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦: Not directly applicable
𝘜𝘴𝘦 𝘤𝘢𝘴𝘦: Optimizing user experience
